      <h2>National Computer Security Day</h2>
      <p>
        National Computer Security Day, and observe it in whatever way you can
        because online safety and security are important things .<br></br>
        <br></br> National Computer Security Day began in 1988, around the time
        that computers were becoming commonplace, even if they were yet to
        become ubiquitous in homes . While hacking and viruses have virtually
        been around since the early days of modern computing, evolving and
        increasingly sophisticated technologies began to see more applications,
        and therefore more security risks due to the simple fact that more data
        was at risk as computers found their way into banks, government offices,
        and businesses . <br></br>
        <br></br>Cyber craft Hackathon is a nationwide initiative to provide
        students a platform to solve some of pressing problems we face in our
        daily lives, and thus inculcate a culture of product innovation and a
        mindset of problem solving. The students would also have the opportunity
        to work on challenges faced within the private sector organizations and
        create world class solutions for some of the top companies in the world,
        thus helping the Private sector hire the best minds from across the
        nation.{" "}
